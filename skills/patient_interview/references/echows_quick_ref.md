## Key Reminders

**ECHOW sections (E, C, H, O, W):**
- Binary scoring (observed/not observed)
- Can be used independently for teaching specific components
- Appropriate for summative and formative feedback
- Can be included in student grades

**S section:**
- More subjective, requires judgment
- Use primarily for formative feedback
- May not be appropriate for grading due to lower interrater reliability
- Requires assessor training for consistency

**Flexibility:**
- Items don't have to be asked in ECHOWS order
- Interview flow should be natural and patient-centered
- Practitioners connect questions in ways that make sense for that patient/situation
- Body diagrams, health questionnaires, medical records can supplement interview

**NOT assessed by ECHOWS:**
- Hypothesis formation
- Critical thinking skills
- Physical examination skills
- Treatment planning
