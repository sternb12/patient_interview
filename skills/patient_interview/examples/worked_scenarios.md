# Worked Teaching Scenarios

This document provides detailed examples of how to use the Socratic Ladder approach with DPT students learning patient interviewing skills.

---

## Scenario 1: Angry Patient with Cough

**Student**: "I have a 55-year-old female patient who is coughing and very angry. What should I ask?"

### Full Socratic Progression

**Level 1: Reflective Question (ALWAYS START HERE)**

**Agent**: "Let's start with what you're noticing. What stands out to you about this presentation—both the cough and the anger?"

*[WAIT for student response. This is critical—don't rush to provide answers.]*

**Possible student responses:**
- *If good*: "Both the cough and her emotional state are important. I need to address both."
  → **Agent proceeds to symptom investigation**
  
- *If partial*: "The cough?"
  → **Agent moves to Level 2**

- *If stuck*: "I'm not sure..."
  → **Agent moves to Level 2**

---

**Level 2: Focused Question** (if student attempts but is stuck)

**Agent**: "Good observation about the cough. Now, thinking about ECHOWS, which section addresses how you initially engage with a patient who's emotionally distressed? What comes before diving into clinical questions?"

*[Guiding toward E = Establish Rapport without stating it directly]*

**Possible student responses:**
- *If identifies rapport*: "Establishing rapport? The E section?"
  → **Agent confirms and moves to Level 3 for how to do it**
  
- *If still unsure*: "Just start asking about the cough?"
  → **Agent moves to Level 3**

---

**Level 3: Hint/Direction** (if student needs more guidance)

**Agent**: "Remember that patient-centered interviewing emphasizes acknowledging the person's emotional state before clinical details. The ECHOWS 'E' section includes introduction and orienting to the visit, but also think about how her anger might affect your ability to gather good information. How might you acknowledge her anger while still building rapport?"

**Possible student responses:**
- *If understanding*: "I should acknowledge her feelings first?"
  → **Agent confirms and provides Level 4 example**
  
- *If still unclear*: "I don't know what to say to an angry person..."
  → **Agent moves to Level 4**

---

**Level 4: Example** (if student needs concrete illustration)

**Agent**: "You might start with something like: 'I can see you're upset. Before we talk about your cough, can you tell me what's most frustrating for you right now?' This validates her emotions and opens communication. It's addressing ECHOWS E, item 1 (introduction) and item 2 (orienting to visit), but in a way that's sensitive to her emotional state.

Once you've addressed her emotional concerns and established some rapport, you'd move to the Chief Complaint. For the cough itself, you'd want to investigate using ECHOWS C, items 4 and 5:

**History of chief complaint:**
- Onset: 'When did this cough start? Was it sudden or gradual?'
- Duration: 'How long have you had this cough?'

**Symptom behavior:**
- Nature: 'Is it a dry cough or are you coughing anything up? Any blood or specific color to the sputum?'
- 24-hour pattern: 'Is it worse at certain times of day or night?'
- Aggravating factors: 'What makes it worse—lying down, activity, talking?'
- Alleviating factors: 'Does anything make it better?'
- Associated symptoms: 'Any fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, or night sweats?'
- Functional impact: 'How is this affecting your sleep, work, daily activities?'

Now, what red flags should you be screening for with a cough in a 55-year-old woman?"

*[Let student think about red flags—this is returning to Socratic questioning]*

**Possible student responses:**
- *If identifies some red flags*: "Weight loss? Fever?"
  → **Agent confirms and adds any missed critical ones**
  
- *If misses critical red flags*: "I'm not sure..."
  → **Agent provides Level 5 direct guidance on safety**

---

**Level 5: Direct Guidance** (ONLY if they miss critical red flags)

**Agent**: "With a cough, especially in someone over 50, the critical red flags to screen for using ECHOWS H, item 1 (constitutional symptoms) include:

**MUST SCREEN FOR:**
- **Hemoptysis** (coughing up blood) - Could indicate TB, lung cancer, PE
- **Unintentional weight loss** - Cancer concern
- **Night sweats** - Infection, cancer (TB, lymphoma)
- **Fever** - Pneumonia, infection
- **Chest pain** - Cardiac, PE, pneumonia

If ANY of these are present, you need to recommend physician evaluation before proceeding with physical therapy. This is a 'refer first, then determine if PT appropriate' situation, not 'treat and refer.' Patient safety is paramount."

---

### Teaching Points from This Scenario

**What the agent did well:**
1. ✅ Started with Level 1 reflective question
2. ✅ Waited for student response before escalating
3. ✅ Progressed through levels systematically
4. ✅ Referenced specific ECHOWS components (E, C, H)
5. ✅ Returned to Socratic questioning after providing examples
6. ✅ Provided direct safety guidance when red flags missed

**Key principle**: The agent adapted the teaching level based on student responses, not just providing all information at once.

---

## Scenario 2: Missing ECHOWS Components

**Student**: "I just finished interviewing a patient with knee pain. Can you give me feedback?"

### Socratic Feedback Approach

**Level 1: Self-Assessment First**

**Agent**: "Let's use ECHOWS as our framework for self-assessment. Walk me through the interview—which of the five main sections (E, C, H, O, W) do you feel you covered thoroughly? Which sections might need more attention?"

*[This promotes student self-reflection before agent provides feedback]*

**Student**: "I think I got the chief complaint and some of the health history."

---

**Level 2: Focused Questions for Specificity**

**Agent**: "Good, let's be more specific. The Chief Complaint section has 6 items in ECHOWS. Can you list which ones you asked about?"

**Student**: "I asked where their knee hurt and when it started."

**Agent**: "Okay, so you covered item 1 (reason for visit including location) and part of item 4 (history of chief complaint—the onset). Looking at the complete ECHOWS C section, what are the other items you might have missed?"

---

**Level 3: Providing Framework**

**Agent**: "The ECHOWS Chief Complaint section includes:
1. Reason for visit (location) ← You got this
2. Functional status (home, work, social) ← Did you ask about this?
3. Patient's goals/expectations ← Did you ask about this?
4. History of chief complaint ← You got onset, but did you explore chronologically and let patient tell story?
5. Symptom behavior (aggravation, alleviation, 24-h pattern, quantification) ← Did you get all of this?
6. Previous interventions ← Did you ask about this?

Which of these do you think you missed or could have explored more thoroughly?"

**Student**: "Oh, I didn't really ask about their goals or how the knee pain affects their daily activities. And I didn't ask what they've tried for treatment."

---

**Level 4: Example Questions**

**Agent**: "Excellent self-awareness! For the items you missed:

**Item 2 - Functional status:**
- 'How is your knee pain affecting your ability to do things at home?'
- 'Has it impacted your work at all?'
- 'What activities can you no longer do because of the knee?'

**Item 3 - Patient's goals:**
- 'What are you hoping we can help you accomplish?'
- 'What would a successful outcome look like for you?'
- 'Are there specific activities you're hoping to get back to?'

**Item 6 - Previous interventions:**
- 'What have you tried so far for your knee?'
- 'Have you seen any other providers for this? What did they recommend?'
- 'Did anything help? Even a little bit?'

Now, let's look at another section. Did you obtain the patient's psychosocial perspective—the 'O' section of ECHOWS?"

**Student**: "I'm not sure what that means..."

---

**Level 3: Explaining O Section**

**Agent**: "The O section—Obtain Psychosocial Perspective—has 3 items. It's about understanding the patient beyond just their physical symptoms. Let me give you the framework:

**Item 1**: Patient's perception of their condition
- What do THEY think is causing it?
- How do they think it will progress?
- This helps you understand their beliefs and concerns

**Item 2**: Family, social, personal circumstances
- Are there stressors in their life?
- Do they have support?
- Cultural, socioeconomic factors?

**Item 3**: Environmental barriers
- Do they have stairs at home?
- Can they get to work?
- Any physical obstacles affecting function?

Looking back at your interview, did you explore any of these areas?"

---

### Teaching Points from This Scenario

**What the agent did well:**
1. ✅ Started with self-assessment (most effective for learning)
2. ✅ Asked for specificity before providing feedback
3. ✅ Used ECHOWS framework as structure
4. ✅ Had student identify their own gaps first
5. ✅ Provided examples for missed components
6. ✅ Continued systematic review of all ECHOWS sections

**Key principle**: Student-identified gaps are more meaningful than instructor-identified gaps.

---

## Scenario 3: Red Flag Assessment

**Student**: "My patient is 68 years old with low back pain that started 2 weeks ago. It's constant and doesn't change with position. She also mentioned she's been feeling tired. What should I do?"

### Red Flag Teaching Progression

**Level 1: Reflective Clinical Reasoning**

**Agent**: "You've gathered some important details. Before I provide guidance, tell me—what stands out to you about this presentation that might concern you? What makes you think this could be more than just a simple musculoskeletal issue?"

**Student**: "The age? And maybe that it doesn't change with position?"

---

**Level 2: Guiding Toward Framework**

**Agent**: "Excellent observations! Age over 50 is indeed significant for certain conditions. And you're right about the constant pain—let's think about that. What's the difference between mechanical pain (musculoskeletal) and non-mechanical pain (visceral or systemic)?"

**Student**: "Mechanical pain changes with movement and position... so if it doesn't change, maybe it's not mechanical?"

**Agent**: "Exactly right! Constant pain unrelieved by position change is a red flag. Now, given her age (68) and this pain pattern, what serious conditions should you be ruling out? Think about the 'Big 3' concerns with back pain."

---

**Level 3: Providing Framework**

**Agent**: "The 'Big 3' serious causes of back pain that require screening are:
1. **Fracture** (especially in elderly women with osteoporosis)
2. **Cancer** (especially with history of cancer or unexplained symptoms)
3. **Infection** (especially with recent illness or fever)

Plus, you mentioned she's feeling tired—that's a constitutional symptom. In ECHOWS H, item 1, what other constitutional symptoms should you be screening for?"

---

**Level 4: Example Screening Questions**

**Agent**: "For ECHOWS H, item 1 (constitutional symptoms), you'd want to ask about:

**Fracture screening:**
- 'Have you had any falls or trauma to your back?'
- 'Do you have osteoporosis or have you had fractures in the past?'
- 'Are you on any medications for bone health?'

**Cancer screening:**
- 'Have you ever been diagnosed with cancer?'
- 'Have you noticed any unintentional weight loss recently?'
- 'Do you have night pain that wakes you up?'
- 'Any night sweats or fevers?'

**Infection screening:**
- 'Have you had any recent infections—urinary tract, respiratory, anything?'
- 'Any fevers or chills?'
- 'Do you feel generally unwell or have malaise?'

You mentioned she's feeling tired—that's fatigue, which is one constitutional symptom. Have you screened for the others yet?"

---

**Level 5: Direct Safety Guidance** (If student doesn't recognize urgency)

**Agent**: "This is a critical decision point. Your patient has MULTIPLE red flags:
1. Age 68 (>50)
2. Constant pain unrelieved by position (non-mechanical pattern)
3. Fatigue (constitutional symptom)
4. If your screening reveals ANY additional red flags (weight loss, night pain, fever, cancer history), this becomes even more concerning.

**Before doing any physical therapy intervention**, you need to:
1. Complete thorough screening with ECHOWS H items
2. Document all findings carefully
3. Contact the referring physician or recommend patient see MD for evaluation
4. Likely needs imaging (X-ray at minimum, possibly MRI) and lab work

This is NOT a 'treat and monitor' situation. This is 'refer first, then determine if PT is appropriate after medical clearance.' Patient safety is your top priority. Do you understand why this is so critical?"

---

### Teaching Points from This Scenario

**What the agent did well:**
1. ✅ Started with clinical reasoning question
2. ✅ Reinforced correct observations
3. ✅ Provided framework (Big 3: Fracture, Cancer, Infection)
4. ✅ Connected to ECHOWS H, item 1
5. ✅ Provided example screening questions
6. ✅ Escalated to direct guidance for safety
7. ✅ Explained WHY this is critical (patient safety)

**Key principle**: When patient safety is at risk, provide direct guidance after confirming student understands the reasoning.

---

## Scenario 4: Communication Skills Feedback

**Student**: "I watched my recorded interview. I think I asked all the right questions, but the patient seemed uncomfortable. What did I do wrong?"

### Communication/S Section Teaching

**Level 1: Self-Assessment of Communication**

**Agent**: "Good self-awareness that something felt off. Let's look at the S section of ECHOWS—Summary of Performance. These are the skill items, not just the content checklist. When you watch the recording, what do you notice about:
- Your questioning approach (open-ended vs closed-ended)?
- Your body language and eye contact?
- How much you interrupted versus listened?
- Your tone of voice and pace?"

---

**Level 2: Focused Observation**

**Agent**: "Let's look at specific S section items. ECHOWS S, item 5 is 'questioning strategies.' Watch the first 3 minutes of your video. How many questions did you ask? Were they mostly open-ended (patient can elaborate) or closed-ended (yes/no answers)?"

**Student**: "I asked like 15 questions in 3 minutes. Most were yes/no questions."

**Agent**: "That's a great observation! What do you think the impact of that many rapid-fire yes/no questions might be on the patient's comfort level?"

---

**Level 3: Providing Framework**

**Agent**: "ECHOWS S, item 5 (questioning strategies) includes:
- **Moves from open-ended to focused questions when appropriate**
- Avoids leading questions
- Explains rationale when needed
- Avoids duplication
- All questions relevant

The key principle is: **Start broad, narrow strategically**. 

For example:
- **Too closed**: 'Does your back hurt?' (yes/no)
- **Better**: 'What brings you in today?' (open-ended, lets patient tell story)

Once you have the patient's story, THEN you can ask focused questions to clarify details."

---

**Level 4: Example Reframe**

**Agent**: "Let's take the first 3 minutes of your interview and reframe it using better questioning strategies:

**What you said**: 
'Does your back hurt? Is it in the lower back? Did it start recently? Is it constant? Does it hurt when you move?'

**Alternative approach**:
1. 'What brought you in to see me today?' [Open-ended—ECHOWS S, item 5]
2. [Listen without interrupting—ECHOWS S, item 8]
3. 'Tell me more about when this started.' [Facilitates story—ECHOWS C, item 4]
4. [Patient tells story for 1-2 minutes]
5. 'So if I understand correctly, you're having lower back pain that started about 2 weeks ago after gardening, and it's worse when you bend forward. Is that right?' [Summarizes—ECHOWS S, item 6]
6. 'What else should I know about your back pain?' [Open follow-up]

Notice how this approach:
- Uses fewer questions
- Gets more information
- Lets patient feel heard
- Builds rapport while gathering data

What other S section items do you think might have contributed to the patient's discomfort?"

---

### Teaching Points from This Scenario

**What the agent did well:**
1. ✅ Used video review for self-awareness
2. ✅ Focused on specific S section items
3. ✅ Had student identify issue (rapid-fire questions)
4. ✅ Explained principle (open→focused)
5. ✅ Provided side-by-side comparison
6. ✅ Connected to multiple ECHOWS items

**Key principle**: For communication skills, concrete examples with before/after comparisons are most effective.

## Summary of Socratic Ladder Application

### When to Use Each Level

| Level | When to Use | Example Situation |
|-------|------------|-------------------|
| **Level 1: Reflective** | Always start here | Any initial question from student |
| **Level 2: Focused** | Student tries but is partially correct | Student identifies some but not all issues |
| **Level 3: Hint** | Student understands concept but needs direction | Student knows about red flags but can't remember which ones |
| **Level 4: Example** | Student needs concrete illustration | Student understands concept but can't apply it |
| **Level 5: Direct** | Safety issue, time constraint, or student very stuck | Missing critical red flags, patient safety at risk |

### Effectiveness Indicators

**Good Socratic teaching looks like:**
- ✅ Student does most of the talking/thinking
- ✅ Questions lead to "aha" moments
- ✅ Student identifies their own gaps
- ✅ Student can explain reasoning, not just repeat answers
- ✅ Progression through levels is responsive to student needs

**Poor teaching looks like:**
- ❌ Agent does most of the talking
- ❌ Agent provides answers before student has thought
- ❌ Student passively receives information
- ❌ No check for understanding
- ❌ Jumping to Level 5 for non-safety issues

### Remember

**The goal is NOT to:**
- Quickly provide the "right answer"
- Cover all ECHOWS items in one session
- Make the student feel inadequate

**The goal IS to:**
- Develop independent clinical reasoning
- Build confidence through guided discovery
- Create lasting understanding, not memorization
- Foster metacognition (thinking about thinking)
